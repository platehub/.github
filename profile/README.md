# Multisite

Does your company or organization manage multiple labels, brands, or associations? Do you have one or more offices abroad? If you're seeking an efficient way to manage websites for all these entities, look no further.

Plate offers content managers a dynamic [multisite CMS](https://www.getplate.com/multisite-management) that combines the ease of a website builder with powerful features. Manage content and functionality either centrally or decentrally. Take control of distinct branding, scale effortlessly, and forget about security, integrations, and upgrades. Here's what sets our turnkey multisite CMS apart:

## Multi-tenant CMS

Unlike other CMSs—most of which are Open Source—Plate offers a multi-tenant CMS. This means all 1,000 of our customers run on the same version. No more juggling different versions of plugins or server configurations. Instead, you get an always-up-to-date platform hosted on AWS, fortified with DDoS protection, WAF, and a slew of advanced features. Plus, we roll out weekly updates that include bug fixes and new feature releases.

## User-friendly CMS Experience

Content is king. Want to dominate search engines? Content. Launching an inbound marketing strategy? Content. Need a compelling proposition? Content. Introducing a new segment, product, or label? Again, content. Everything revolves around content, and as a Content Marketer, it's your job to make it work. This is why Plate is the ideal CMS for Content Marketers:

### User-friendly Interface

If you're a Content Marketer, you've likely had good experiences with page builders. You want that same ease when managing content on your website(s). No complicated dashboards—just a fast and intuitive interface that lets you set up content experiences in a snap.

### Centralized Content Management

Your time is too valuable to waste on duplicating efforts. Add new content in one place, translate it into another language, and create fresh content experiences—all from a single dashboard.

### Create Multiple Experiences

Raw information isn't enough. You want to transform it into engaging experiences for your target audience. Why limit yourself to a corporate job page when you could also launch a dedicated work-from-home site to fill vacancies faster? The more experiences you create, the closer you get to your goals.

### Work Independently

Tired of waiting on your internal development team or agency for minor changes? As a content marketer, you want the freedom to create and publish new experiences without needing a developer. With Plate, you're in full control of your content and channels. Plus, our CMS takes care of the nitty-gritty, like image compression, so you can focus on what really matters.
